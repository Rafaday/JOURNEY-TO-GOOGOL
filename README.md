A playful web experiment where you try (and fail ðŸ˜‰) to reach a Googol (10^100) by clicking buttons or letting an auto-clicker bot help you.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Manual buttons to add different increments (1, 10, 100, 10^6, 10^12, 10^18, 10^50).
- BigInt support for extremely large numbers.
- Auto-clicker bot (50 clicks per second) for automated counting.
- Responsive design with a clean UI.
