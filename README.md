# Journey to Googol

A playful web experiment where you try (and fail 😉) to reach a Googol (10^100) by clicking buttons or letting an auto-clicker bot help you.

## 🌟 Features
- Manual buttons to add different increments (1, 10, 100, 10^6, 10^12, 10^18, 10^50).
- BigInt support for extremely large numbers.
- Auto-clicker bot (50 clicks per second) for automated counting.
- Responsive design with a clean UI.

## 🚀 Demo
(If you plan to host it on GitHub Pages, add the link here, e.g.  
`https://Rafaday.github.io/journey-to-googol/`)

## 📦 Installation
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:
